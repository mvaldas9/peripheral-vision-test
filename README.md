# Peripheral Vision Test

This is a web application built with React and Vite that tests peripheral vision capabilities. The app displays shapes in different positions on the screen while maintaining the user's focus on a central point, helping to assess peripheral vision accuracy.

## Features

- Dynamic shape display in peripheral vision areas
- Configurable test parameters:
  - Shape size and display duration
  - Screen calibration options
  - Custom colors and styles
- Results tracking and analysis
- Support for multiple shapes (circle, square, triangle, star, cross)

## Technical Stack

- React for the UI framework
- Vite for build tooling and development server
- Local storage for settings persistence
- Modern CSS for styling

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Run the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

## Usage

The test presents shapes in your peripheral vision while maintaining focus on a central point. After each display, you'll need to identify both the central and peripheral shapes shown. The application tracks your accuracy and provides detailed results.
